# This is the implementation of a car with C.

## I implemented it in Germany, that's the reason that everything in the code is written German.

###### There is a racing circuit, and in that circuit, there is a few challanges such as crossroads, bridges and curves.

###### There might be more than one car in this racing circuit. That's why we need to avoid collision. For avoiding collisions, I provided control with **Threads.**

###### There are also different challanges here except collisions. For example, the car needs to accelerate to cross the bridge. In addition, the car needs to stop completely, when the car reached to crosspoint.

###### When there is a curve on the road, the car needs to brake in order to continue down the road safely.
